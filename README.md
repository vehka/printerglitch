# printerglitch

A p5.js script that creates images that are inspired by glitchy printers.

Open the printerglitch.html in your browser and experiment. Large canvas sizes might be slow to use.

Created over a weekend in December 2025 by vehka. Lots of help from Gemini & Antigravity + Claude Sonnet 4.5 & Claude Code.
