# TODO

* diagonal repetition "curves" – add random horizontal spaces in repetition, so that the diagonal lines are not linear
* colours?
* custom canvas dimensions
* input boxes to enter slider values (useful with large canvases)
* redoing character ghosting shouldn't re-randomize all the characters
* the small, round "photocopier stains" should be more irregular, numerous, and a bit smaller and with higher contrast
* repetition effects should have a parameter that controls spacing probability: empty lines between characters
